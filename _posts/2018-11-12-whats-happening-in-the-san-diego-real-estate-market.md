Today I’ve got an update for you on our real estate market and what’s been happening this month in San Diego. **Here are some of the numbers that you need to know from our changing market.**

* The average days on market is 52 days.
* We currently have 9,486 single-family homes that are listed for sale.
* The average list price of homes is $721,000.
* The average sold price of homes is $859,000.
* The highest-priced home that sold this month in San Diego was sold for $13.3 million.

**These numbers mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.** I used to work for Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Chase Bank as a listing agent during the REO days and they would have me analyze the numbers and how they related to different neighborhoods and special demographics. Believe me when I say that there are so many different factors that determine what the price of your home would be. Each home and each case is different.

If you have any questions for me about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you soon.
