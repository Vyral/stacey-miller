I’m coming to you today from the beautiful highrise in the sixth floor of the Pinnacle, which has incredible views of Coronado Island. So far this year in the 92101 zip code, 14 homes in this same price range have sold. It seems there has been a shift in the market. Now, homes and condos seem to be on the market for about 33 days, and if they’re over $1 million or they just aren’t priced properly, they can be on for as long as four to six months. If you want to learn more specific information about your property, reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you.
