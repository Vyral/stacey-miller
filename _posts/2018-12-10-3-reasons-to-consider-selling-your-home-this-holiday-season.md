There are actually three reasons why the holiday season remains a great seller’s market:

**1. There is less inventory on the market.** Because of that, there will be fewer competing sellers, meaning your home will stand out more to buyers.

**2. Your home has never looked better.** Now that you have it decorated for the holidays, your home will make anyone who comes in feel more welcomed.

**3. There are fewer looky-loos.** This time of year tends to bring out mostly serious buyers, meaning that you’ll waste less time entertaining looky-loos and tire kickers. The buyers out during the holidays have a sense of urgency, so they’ll want to move quickly, possibly meaning more money for you.
