We all remember the real estate meltdown in 2008, but not everyone realizes that this otherwise sordid chapter in our market’s history actually had a very positive impact on the rental market—which has been doing well ever since.

With that in mind, there are three primary reasons you should consider investing in a vacation rental property.

**1. The majority of people prefer vacation rentals to hotels.** According to a study by Airbnb, 68% of people would prefer to stay in a rental over a hotel, if possible.

**2. Property values for rentals are increasing by 11% per year on average.**

**3. There is no rent control (so far) in San Diego.**
