I met with my friend and long-time client the other day to catch up. After a nice lunch at the Prado, we took a walk together on the sunny San Diego streets. To my excitement, we found a wishing well! I got goosebumps as I thought of all the support I’ve received from my friends, family, and clients; my wishes have already come true! It was a good moment to reflect on the things I’m grateful for and the people who keep me going. As you spend Thanksgiving with the people closest to you, don’t forget to let them know your gratitude. Thinking back to the wishing well, I suppose I did have a wish: I wish you and your family a happy Thanksgiving!
